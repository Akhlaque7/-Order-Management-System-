# -Order-Management-System-
Microservices-based Order Management System with AWS Cloud Integration  In this project, we are developing a robust Order Management System designed as a set of Microservices using the Spring Boot framework. The system aims to efficiently handle product and user interactions for an E-commerce website.
Key Features:

Microservices Architecture:
* The OMS is structured as a collection of independent microservices, each handling specific functionalities such as user management and order processing.
* MS ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability of the system.

Spring Boot Framework:
* Leveraging the Spring Boot framework to facilitate rapid development of microservices with minimal configuration.

Order Tracking:
* Comprehensive order tracking system to monitor the status of orders from placement to delivery.
* Real-time updates for users on the progress of their orders.
User and Product Management:
* Efficient user management system for account creation, login, and order history tracking.
* Product catalog management to add, update, and remove products seamlessly.

Cloud Integration with AWS:
* The entire system is deployed on the AWS Cloud to benefit from its scalability, reliability, and easy.
* Utilizing AWS services for hosting, database storage, and CI through a well-defined deployment pipeline.
Build and Deployment Pipeline:
* Implementation of a CI/CD pipeline ensures automated building, testing, and deployment of microservices, reducing manual errors and accelerating the development lifecycle.

Technologies Used:
* Spring Boot, Java
* AWS Cloud Services (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.)
* Docker for containerization
* Jenkins for CI/CD
* MySQL for database management

Outcome:
The Microservices-based Order Management System will provide a scalable and resilient solution for handling E-commerce order processes efficiently. Its cloud-native architecture ensures flexibility, and the CI/CD pipeline guarantees a streamlined development and deployment process.
